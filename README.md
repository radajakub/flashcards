# Flashcards

A graduation app for learning vocabulary or other material.
The user creates flashcards with vocabulary words, which he/she classifies into arbitrary headings.
The user is then tested on these headings with three types of tests.

## Installation and launching

For proper functioning, you need to have `Python 3.6` or higher and `Django 2.1.5` installed (install using `pip install django=2.1.5`).

To install the developer version, you need to have `npm` installed.

Installing the application

1. Clone the Github repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/JakubRada/Flashcards.git`
2. Moving to the appropriate folder
    - `cd Flashcards/user_interface/`
3. Installing using `npm`
    - `npm install`

First you need to start the server. In the server folder (it contains the `manage.py` file), run `python manage.py runserver localhost:8000`.

After that, the application itself will start. Either by running the `flashcards.exe` file on Windows, or the `flashcards` file on Linux.

In development, the application can be started using the `npm start` command in the user_interface folder (you need to have `npm` installed).

More information can be found at [*project website*](https://jakubrada.github.io/Flashcards/index.html), where the user guide and developer documentation are located.
